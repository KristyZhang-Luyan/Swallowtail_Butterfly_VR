# Swallowtail_Butterfly_VR

<h2> 01 Project description </h2>
How would you feel if you were a butterfly seeking to live in a desperate world of chaos? Inspired by the Japanese film 'Swallowtail Butterfly' and the game Cyberpunk 2077, I created a VR game that requires users to survive through three artificial crises. It allows people to think about what they truly need in a dissipated world.
